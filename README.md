## Testing 

  - The responsiveness is run and tested at:
    - http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#

  - The HTML code is run and tested at:
    - https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
    - If you run the code you will get Bad value and Text not allowed in element.
    This is because I'm using
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)" target="_blank"> Jinja (template engine)</a>
  
  
  - The CSS code is run and tested at:
    - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
    
  - The JavaScript is run and tested at:
    - https://jshint.com/  
    
  - The Python is run and tested at:
    - http://pep8online.com/
    - If you run the code you will get the result E501 line too long.
